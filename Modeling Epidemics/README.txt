Modeling Epidemics (SIR) assignment

The goal of this assignment is create code to simulate a simplified version of the SIR epidemic model. The code model how
infection spreads through a city over time, where time is measured in days. At a high level, the code iteratively calculate the
disease states in a city, keeping track of the state of each person within a city until the end of the simulation.
